# NordVPN Router Setup Script

This script will facilitate the complete configuration of a system to become a whole-network VPN router using NordVPN.

This is a work in progress. As of October 1, 2024, I am *completely* rewriting the script from the ground up. My hope is that this new version will be more portable and easier for people to use. Watch for the new script. I will be uploading the first public version soon with instructions for using it!

The new version will cover Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Alma, and CentOS and provide a more uniform and user-friendly interface.

I have been studying and learning from others' scripts and other resources, and I am using those lessons to make this script more effective.

I am by no means a professional programmer. Computers, scripting, programming, etc. are a part-time hobby.
